            <li>Completed Short-term internship in Wadhwani foundation about Empllyability Skills</li>
            <li>Perceived a certificate of course completion on R language</li>
            <li>Community service project on topic of Nutrition</li>
            <li>Internship on full stack development- InternCall</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During my internship with the Wadhwani Foundation, I had the valuable opportunity to engage in projects that encompassed both employability skills and full-stack development. In the employability skills initiative, I actively contributed to crafting programs aimed at enhancing individuals' professional readiness. This involved creating and refining resources that covered areas such as resume building, effective communication, and interview preparation. Collaborating with a diverse team, I played a key role in developing and implementing workshops to impart crucial employability skills to participants.

            Simultaneously, my involvement in the full-stack development project added a technical dimension to my internship experience. I was immersed in designing, developing, and deploying web applications that required a comprehensive understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies. This hands-on experience allowed me to refine my coding skills and gain practical insights into creating robust and user-friendly digital solutions.
            
            As part of the InternCall community service project focusing on nutrition, I embraced the opportunity to contribute to a cause that goes beyond technology. Working closely with a multidisciplinary team, I participated in designing and implementing features for a platform dedicated to providing nutritional information and support to communities in need. This project not only sharpened my technical skills but also underscored the importance of technology in addressing real-world challenges.
            
            Throughout these experiences, I honed my ability to work in a collaborative environment, adapting to various roles within a team. The intersection of employability skills, full-stack development, and community service broadened my perspective and equipped me with a well-rounded skill set. My overarching goal is to leverage these experiences to reach a position where I can continue to enhance my abilities while making meaningful contributions to projects that have a positive impact on society.</p>
